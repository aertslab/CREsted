# Default configuration file for the project.
# !!! Don't edit this file directly !!! 
# Instead, create a user.yml file in /configs and
# add/overwrite the values in the user.yml file.
# User configs take priority over default configs.
# Only update default configs after extensive testing and discussion with team.
