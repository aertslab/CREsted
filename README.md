# DeepPeak: Predicting Chromatin Accessibility from Genome Sequences

DeepPeak is a deep learning framework designed to predict ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) chromatin accessibility. This tool utilizes CNNs to accurately infer the open chromatin regions from genome sequences, facilitating a deeper understanding of gene regulation.
